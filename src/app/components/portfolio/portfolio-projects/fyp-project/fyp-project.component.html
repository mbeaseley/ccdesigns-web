      copy="<p>My final year project at Brunel University was title 'Using Smartphone technology to simulate human
        behaviour within an indoor environment'.</p><ul>
        <li>Created an Android Application which allowed a user to navigate through an indoor environment.</li>
        <li>Project included the use of NFC, Beacons, Wi-Fi, and Java.</li>
        <li>The model used was the Waterfall Model due to the scope of the project but Android development was
          completed using a similar process that the Spiral Model presented.</li>
        <li>A literature review was conducted as well as a survey data was researched to underline the requirements
          of the application.</li>
        <li>Created Low and High fidelity prototypes of the User Interface, whereas Class, Sequential and Use case
          diagram was created to developed how and what variables and processes are needed.</li>
        <li>The development of the application was conducted on Android Studio alongside an external Software
          Development Kit from Indooratlas.</li>
        <li>The application was tested using requirement verification as well as performance testing through GPU and
          CPU monitoring.</li>
        <li>The application was evaluated against major application on battery usage, accuracy, and loading times.</li>
